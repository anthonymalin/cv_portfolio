            <h3>Real Estate Development</h3>
            <p>In 2016 I got involved in commercial real estate development. The recent project I worked on as an executive manager was a mixed use 85,000 SqFt 
              redevelopment in Fort Lauderdale called THRIVE. I worked closely with the City/County, architect, engineers, subcontractors, insurance, etc.
              I did property management and leasing, designed all marketing materials, planned and executed all online and offline marketing activities to 
              promote the project.</p>
